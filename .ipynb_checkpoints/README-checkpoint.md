# Solitaire
Solitaire is a tabletop game that anyone an play by themselves.  The card version goes back to the late 1700s across Northern Europe and Scandinavia.  Another name for the card version of the game is Patience which is definitely a requirement	 for completing the game.

## How to play
### Introduction
- The deck consists of a standard pack of 52 cards, 4 suits (diamonds, clubs, hearts, spades) and 13 ranks for each suit from Ace to King.
- The objective of the game is to build up each of the four foundations with their respective suits starting with Ace going up to King.

### The Board
- The 7 piles of cards beneath the foundation is called the tableau. They are distributed cards starting with the left pile containing 1 card and subsequent piles with an additional card going up to 7.  The tableau piles have each of their first cards revealed.  
- The stock pile is the remaining cards not distributed onto the tableau located at the top left.
- The waste pile is the pile next to the stock pile and starts out empty.

### Gameplay
- Only face up cards are able to be moved throughout the board
- Building: using the cards available, you can stack cards of descending value and alternating color under any other visible card on the board.  This way, you are able to unblock cards that are underneath each tableau pile so they can be revealed.
- If there are no more moves available on the tableau, you can utilize the stock pile by flipping over the top card.  This card can be played onto the foundation or tableau.  If not, you can continue to flip over cards from the stock but are only able to use the card on top.
- Space: a vacancy created on the tableau by clearing all the cards from that pile.  You are only able to place a King on a space.
- continue to transfer cards between the stock/tableau to the foundation pile and complete all 4 foundation piles to win!
